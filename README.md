# 🤖 Custom Automation Agent

This project is a Python-based automation agent developed as part of the **Web AI Class** at **Ideoversity**. It demonstrates how to build autonomous tools that can interact with real-world communication services.

##  Key Features
- **SMTP Protocol Integration:** Connects securely to mail servers using Python's `smtplib`.
- **Automated Communication:** Capable of delivering structured reports and personal logs.
- **Security Best Practices:** Implements authentication via Google App Passwords to protect account credentials.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `smtplib`, `email.mime`
- **Infrastructure:** P2P Clouds Architecture

##  Project Goal
The goal of this assignment was to move beyond basic coding and create an "Agent" that can perform a specific task (sending an email) independently. This serves as a foundation for building more complex, multi-agent systems in the future.

##  Mentorship
Developed under the guidance of **Sir Zeeshan Ali**.
